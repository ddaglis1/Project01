User #1: Owner of Sarah's Mathematics Tutoring

As owner and a mathematics tutor, I needed a website that not only presents my qualifications and offers my availability to potential clients, but a place to collect contact information for students who need help in mathematics. I also need the ability to add resources for current and potential clients such as instructional videos and worksheets that they may find useful in their studies. I am also a fulltime high school mathematics teacher so having a website where I can update my availabilty for students and potential clients makes it much more convenient for me and the student. 


User #2: Current Client/Student of Sarah's Mathematics Tutoring

As a student that gets help from Sarah in Algebra, I use the website to access many resources that are made available to help me in algebra. Sarah also puts here days and hours of availability so I can plan a session when I need help. With my many afterschool activities and other subjects, it is much easier for me to check the website and see what times she has available so that I can plan accordingly.


User #3: Prospective Client/Student of Sarah's Mathematics Tutoring

I am currently struggle with math and I am looking to get some extra help afterschool. I need a website for a tutor that informs me of their credentials, what areas of math they specialize in, their schedule of availability, and a place where I can submit my information if interested so the tutor can contact me. I would also like to see testimonials on the website that gives me an idea of how helpful the tutor was to other students.
