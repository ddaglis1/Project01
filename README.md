QuickStart Project 1 - Creating a Basic Front End Website

Daniel Daglis

## Overview/Description of Project ##
I have designed a website for a tutoring business. This business is run by a current high school math teach where she offers extra help to students in need of additional assistance with their studies. This website is for use by the tutor/owner of the business, potential clients, and current clients. This website offers four pages to the user: (1) a homepage that offers information about the tutor; (2) a page that offers resources to students; (3) a page of testimonials from currnet and past students who have used the tutor's services; and (4) a page where a student who would like to use the services of the tutor can submit their contact information.

## Details and Functionality Offered ##
This site overall meets the very basic needs of the users including Sarah the owner of the tutoring business, her current clients, and potential clients. The functionality offered includes the ability for potential clients to submit their information to Sarah to be contacted about tutoring, the ability for Sarah to post new videos and worksheets that serve as resources for her math students, and the ability to showcase testimonials from past clients on a rotating carousel. 

## Technoligies Used ##
• html
• css
• Bootstrap Carousel
• php

## Ideas for Future Improvements ##
1.	Include an interactive discussion forum for Sarah’s clients to reach out to one another for assistance or questions.
2.	More dynamic design for mobile devices as high school students tend to view everything on their phones and tablets rather than a desktop or laptop.
3.	Widget or link that allows Sarah’s clients to refer a friend for tutoring assistance.
4.	An interactive calendar that gives Sarah the ability to post her schedule a month or so out and show which appointments are filled and which are still available.
