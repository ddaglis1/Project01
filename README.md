QuickStart Project 1 - Creating a Basic Front End Website

Daniel Daglis

Overview/Description of Project:
I have designed a website for a tutoring business. This business is run by a current high school math teach where she offers extra help to students in need of additional assistance with their studies. This website is for use by the tutor/owner of the business, potential clients, and current clients. This website offers four pages to the user: (1) a homepage that offers information about the tutor; (2) a page that offers resources to students; (3) a page of testimonials from currnet and past students who have used the tutor's services; and (4) a page where a student who would like to use the services of the tutor can submit their contact information.
